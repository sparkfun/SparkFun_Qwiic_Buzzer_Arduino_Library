  Example_06_SaveSettings

  This example shows how to save settings to the buzzer.

  It buzzes the buzzer once, and then commands it to save the settings.

  It then does nothing more in the main loop. It is up to you to trigger using
  the TRIGGER header pin.

  NOTE, TRIGGER PIN does utilize frequency, duration and volume. This means you can 
  set it up to be a "momentary" trigger button, or a "one-shot" button.

  When Duration=0, trigger is "momentary" trigger button.

  When Duration>0, trigger will fire a "one-shot" buzz of duration length.

  Note, this is most practically used when planning to trigger the buzzer using
  only the TRIGGER header pin.

  This is useful if you want to set the frequency, duration, volume to your 
  desired settings, and then have it remember them for next time you power your 
  Qwiic buzzer up. Then you can use the TRIGGER header to cause the buzzer to 
  buzz at your saved settings.

  Note, the "on()" function accepts three arguments:
  on(frequency, duration, volume);
