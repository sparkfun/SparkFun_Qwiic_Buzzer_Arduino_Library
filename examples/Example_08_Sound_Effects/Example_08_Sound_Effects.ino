  Example_08_Sound_Effects

  This example demos the sound effects included in this library.

  This includes the following sound effects:
    0 (aka "Siren")
      Intended to sound like a siren, starting at a low frequency, and then
      increasing rapidly up and then back down. This sound effect does a
      single "up and down" cycle.

    1 (aka "3 Fast Sirens")
      Similar to the "Siren" sound effect, only faster and goes three times.

    2 (aka "robot saying 'Yes'")
      Intended to sound like a robot saying the word "yes".
      It starts at a low frequency and quickly ramps up to a high frequency, 
      then stops. This can be interpreted by most to be an affirmative
      sound to any question you may ask your buzzing robot.      

    3 (aka "robot yelling 'YES!'" - faster)
      Same as the "Yes" sound effect, only faster.
      When done more quickly, it can add enthusiasm to the buzzing sound.

    4 (aka "robot saying 'No'")
      Intended to sound like a robot saying the word "no".
      It starts at a high frequency and quickly ramps down to a low frequency, 
      then stops. This can be interpreted by most to be an negative
      sound to any question you may ask your buzzing robot. 

    5 (aka "robot yelling 'NO!'" - faster)
      Same as the "No" sound effect, only faster.
      When done more quickly, it can add enthusiasm to the buzzing sound.

    6 (aka "Laughing Robot")
      Intended to sound like your robot is laughing at you.

    7 (aka "Laughing Robot Faster")
      Same as the "Laugh" sound effect, only faster.
      When done more quickly, it can add enthusiasm to the buzzing sound.

    8 (aka "Crying Robot")
      Intended to sound like a robot is crying and sad.

    9 (aka "Crying Robot Faster")
      Same as the "Cry" sound effect, only faster.
      When done more quickly, it can add enthusiasm to the buzzing sound.
